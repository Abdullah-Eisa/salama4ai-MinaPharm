 ********* ML Engineer Technical Assesment:

Objective:

You are provided with a medical related dataset, containing 5k articles. You are required to demonstrate your NLP, data-mining & topic extraction skills to extract the topics that are included within the dataset along with mapping each article to the corresponding topic names. Each document should be matched to the top three most relevant topic names including the matching probability score.

Kindly, mention how you came up with the optimum number of topics extracted and a final evaluation statement of your work.
